## Introduction to Programming with Java

In this 10 week course, students will learn how to use the object-oriented programming language Java and apply it in a hands-on group project. The students will learn Java through a lecture and practice format, and complete multiple exercises for homework. We are still in the process of deciding the final project. At the end of the course, students will present their finished work to their classmates at a virtual Fair. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15dzZFY-YwrDuhJfZL7RTMdi3OQg7TImaoDz-PdbCuxg/edit?usp=sharing) is the curriculum for the Java course.

## Logistics

Below are the logistics for the pilot program taking place from January 23, 2021 to March 27, 2021.

**Weekly lessons** will take place on Saturdays from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm Jordan time for 2-3 hours via Zoom. If students do not have their own laptops, a laptop will be provided to them. 

**Office hours** are every Sunday and Wednesday from 4 to 6 pm Jordan time.

## Requirements

The students or mentees must be in the 8th grade or higher. They must speak with a proficient level of English and be available for at least one video session per week. The mentors must be in the 11th grade or higher, taken the AP Computer Science A Exam, and demonstrated academic excellence in STEM subjects. We hope to expand the program to include more students/mentees and mentors.
