## Java with App Development

In this 10 week course, students will learn how to use the object-oriented programming language Java and apply it in a hands-on group project. The students will learn Java through a lecture and practice format, and complete multiple exercises for homework. In the group project, students will build a mobile application of their choice using Android Studio. At the end of the course, students will present their mobile application to their classmates at a virtual App Fair. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15dzZFY-YwrDuhJfZL7RTMdi3OQg7TImaoDz-PdbCuxg/edit?usp=sharing) is the curriculum for the Java course.

## Logistics

Lessons will take place on Saturdays from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm Jordan time for 2-3 hours via Zoom. The program starts on Jan 23, 2021. If students do not have their own laptops, a laptop will be provided to them.

## Requirements

The students or mentees must be in the 8th grade or higher. They must speak with a proficient level of English and be available for at least one video session per week. The mentors must be in the 11th grade or higher, taken the AP Computer Science A Exam, and demonstrated academic excellence in STEM subjects. This is a pilot program, but we hope to expand the program to include more students/mentees and mentors.
